<p>1. The organ transplant system relies on an evaluation before a patient is placed on a waiting list, which includes both medical and social factors. I want to show how the social support evaluation in particular means that most people who receive an organ are generally better off. Of course, having medical and social work staff want the patient to have the best possible chances of recovery. But my project would visibly demonstrate that getting a donor organ is not a free, fair process, that you must already have certain advantages.
<br>The United Network of Organ Sharing (http://www.unos.org/) has an extensive online data base, and a data request system. I know they collect information pertaining to the recipientâ€™s education level, which might be one good measure to show class. There is also available data on how many patients pay with Medicaid. 
Other data might come from the Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.hhs.gov/), but this might require a FOIA. 
<br>Human sources: transplant doctors, social workers working in transplant departments, academics who have written about inequality in organ donations, patients denied listing on the organ waiting list
<br>Things to learn: anything other data besides education level and Medicaid available? Are there any programs that specifically try to make donor organs available to the poor and underserved? In terms of skills, I would need to learn how to make some graphics and charts that can be manipulated by the user 
<br>This project could be pitched to a news website that does data-driven stories, like Vox
