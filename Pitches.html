<p>1. The organ transplant system relies on an evaluation before a patient is placed on a waiting list, which includes both medical and social factors. I want to show some of the demographics behind who receives donor organs, potentially showing some of the ways certain advantages (like greater access to education) might correlate with better chances of getting an organ. This would probably be a project with a small written component with one or two interviews, and then an interactive feature. One possibility- the user enters their age, race, and educational level, and can see their likihood of getting various organs? Or a less intense version might be some graphs that show a couple versions of the same information.
<br>
This is my data set for the project:
<a href src="UNOS data request.xlsx">UNOS Organ Recipient Info</a>
<br>
The data comes from <a href="http://www.unos.org/">The United Network of Organ Sharing</a> It has an extensive online data base, and a data request system. The data set I have right now is just educational information, but one possibility is including more demographic infomation, like age and race, from UNOS.
<br>Human sources: I have one source I've spoken to, a social worker who works at a transplant center. Other potential sources could be transplant doctors, academics who have written about inequality in organ donations, or patients denied listing on the organ waiting list. I at least need one medical source who can give me a brief overview of how organs are matched, because when I talked with the social worker, I concentrated on talking about the social/family reasons for someone being denied an organ.
<br>Things to learn: Are there any programs that specifically try to make donor organs available to the poor and underserved? In terms of skills, I would need to learn how to make some graphics and charts that can be manipulated by the user. After the last class, I'm guessing this means more java script and jquery, but probably other things as well. Also, this might be too big of a stretch, but if the feature is interactive I would want to be able to design some of the graphics a little, so it's not stock images of hearts and lungs. This would mean learning how to use some illustrator programs, hopefully something I already have in the Adobe Suite.

<br>This project could be pitched to a news website that does data-driven stories, like Vox
