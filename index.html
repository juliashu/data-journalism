Pitches: 
1. The organ transplant system relies on an evaluation before a patient is placed on a waiting list, which includes both medical and social factors. I want to show how the social support evaluation in particular means that most people who receive an organ are generally better off. Of course, having medical and social work staff want the patient to have the best possible chances of recovery. But my project would visibly demonstrate that getting a donor organ is not a free, fair process, that you must already have certain advantages.
The United Network of Organ Sharing (http://www.unos.org/) has an extensive online data base, and a data request system. I know they collect information pertaining to the recipient’s education level, which might be one good measure to show class. There is also available data on how many patients pay with Medicaid. 
Other data might come from the Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.hhs.gov/), but this might require a FOIA. 
Human sources: transplant doctors, social workers working in transplant departments, academics who have written about inequality in organ donations, patients denied listing on the organ waiting list
Things to learn: anything other data besides education level and Medicaid available? Are there any programs that specifically try to make donor organs available to the poor and underserved? In terms of skills, I would need to learn how to make some graphics and charts that can be manipulated by the user 
This project could be pitched to a news website that does data-driven stories, like Vox 

2. In many national parks and state parks, the government owned land is peppered with private land inholdings – a source of conflict when it comes to development of land, fire prevention services, and real estate sales. This project would be a map of national parks highlighting the private lands within them and showing when the property has changed hands (often passed through families) and the properties’ proximity to big attractions, like sites in Yosemite. This information is newsworthy because the National Parks Service spends federal money trying to buy out these private landowners, and when the NPS budget is cut, they can afford less buyouts. The preservation of national parks is a critical part of making the wilderness accessible to all people, and private development is a threat. 
Data sources: I would need shape files for maps of national park land, and property records for those areas. I know these are publically available, but my initial research suggested it would have to come from various websites per city, not a national source. 
Human sources: NPS administrators who have tried to buy out inholdings, families that live on these lands, real estate agents who specialize in selling inholdings
Need to learn: how to make maps! Ideally with some form of interactivity or movement within it, that would allow zooming in, clicking on certain areas
Pitching: This story might appeal more to a western based publication, like the Los Angeles Times, because so many park lands are in the west. On the other hand, it does have national relevance because of the federal funding, so maybe publications like the New York Times would be interested as well.

3. Rent regulation and the loss of affordable housing in NYC is a big issue, in part driven by landlords buying older, rent-regulated buildings and converting them to market-rate units through construction, forcing out older tenants, and other unsavory means. I want to create a detailed graphic of certain buildings that have or are undergoing this conversation, and show past and current building violations (boiler problems, construction problems, no heat, etc). These violations show a history of intentionally created problems that force tenants out. 
Data sources: property ownership records and sales from NYC Dept. of Finance, http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/, records on size and number of units and violations from Dept. of Buildings, http://nyc.gov/buildings 
Human sources: tenants associations, advocacy groups that fight tenant harassment, Dept. of Buildings inspectors, construction supervisors at the worksites
Need to learn: lots of data scraping involved, need to create some type of interactive graphic that allows someone to click on a building and see the violations, maybe in a chart or in a drawing
Pitching: A number of NYC-based sites cover this issue, including Curbed and Gothamist, and hyper local sites like Bowery Boogie
